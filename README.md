# Ruby Building Blocks

In this project there were three coding exercises:
<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
<p>
The user can input a message that will be encrypted by shifting each character over by a key value.
</p>
<h2>Stock Picker</h2>
<p>
The user inputs an array of stock prices. The maximum profit is calculated and user will be told which days are the best to buy and sell stocks.
</p>
<h2>Substring</h2>
<p>A dictionary contains an array of words. When the user inputs text it is compared to the dictionary and returns the smaller words found within the inputted words.
</p>
